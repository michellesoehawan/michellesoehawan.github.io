<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>	I am rooted in the capital of the Netherlands, where I was born and raised. 
	However, my love for Amsterdam did not stop me from choosing and wanting an international oriented future.</p>

<p>In 2012 I chose to start my IBMS Bachelor at the Amsterdam University of Applied Sciences to pursue this passion. IBMS enabled me to explore several areas within the international business world. For example, the Amsterdam Finance Club, the study excellence program or studying abroad. In this discovery of interests my journey brought me to Barcelona where I was part of the Erasmus Program at the University of Barcelona. After this experience I decided I wanted to continue my growth as an international professional in this city. 
</p>

<p>Consequently I searched for an internship in Barcelona which I found at HP. After my internship I was offered a job and I wrote my thesis about HP.</p>

		 I choose this course because I am interested in business and cultures. I am very content with this course. First of all because my two passions coexist in this field, namely business and a variety of cultures. And second of all because it gives me great opportunities to develop myself, not only because of the curricular activities but especially because of the extracurricular activities. Like the Amsterdam Finance Club of which I was currently assigned HR manager. Besides business, I love to travel, explore new things, people and cultures. Also I take pleasure in reading, art, music and sports.
